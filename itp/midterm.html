<p><strong>Your midterm is a two week assignment to be presented in class on Wednesday, March 13th.</strong></p>

<p>  It can be anything that <em>builds off of </em> or <em>is inspired by</em> the concepts we've covered this first half of the semester (motion and physics).  You should feel free to think non-traditionally, i.e. your midterm need not be a Processing sketch.  The midterm does not need to be a fully realized project, it is useful to use this time to build out a single component of a larger idea or test out a concept that you are thinking about for a final.  If you are stuck, feel free to come and talk to me.  Or try one of these suggestions:
</p>

<ul class="a">
    <li>Extend one of the examples into 3D</li>
    <li>Design a simulation of a single creature (that you imagine living in a larger eco-system).</li>
    <li>Develop a non keyboard/mouse way of interacting with an environments' forces (i.e. video tracking, sensors, etc.)</li>
    <li>Use physics simulation to fabricate something -- a print, a sculpture, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please write a few sentences in a comment below to describe your idea with any relevant links by Monday, March 4th.  Then on Monday March 4th, comment on at least three other posts with some thoughts and advice.  Pick posts that don't have any comments on them just yet.  I'm trying this with Disqus to see if a threaded discussion is helpful.</p>
